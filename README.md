## CI/CD with GitHub Actions
This project utilizes GitHub Actions to implement a CI/CD workflow with the following features:

1. **Branching Strategy**: The repository has a `main` branch, a `develop` branch, and uses `feature` branches for development.
2. **Pull Request Workflow**: When a Pull Request is submitted to the `develop` branch, a GitHub Action is triggered to execute Cypress component tests.
3. **Automatic Deployment**: When a Pull Request is submitted and merged to the `main` branch, a GitHub Action is triggered to automatically deploy the application to Render.

All Cypress component tests must pass before the application is deployed to production.
